.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.BR Tilda
is a terminal emulator which is highly configurable. The main distinguishing feature of tilda is that it
uses a configurable shortcut to show and hide the tilda window. This allows users to quickly switch between tilda
and other windows only through keyboard shortcuts. When tilda is hidden it will move
outside of the screen until a shortcut is pressed again to show the tilda window. The behaviour of
tilda can be configured using the preferences dialog that is available via the context menu. A subset of the options
can also be configured from the command line as documented below.
.PP
Please note that currently command line options override the settings in the configuration file and
are persisted into the configuration file.
.PP
Tilda is using an X11 filter function to register its hotkeys. On Wayland this
method only works while other X11-based programs are active but we cannot send
hotkeys to tilda while native Wayland applications have the focus. Therefore, on
Wayland desktops tilda needs to be started with DBus support and a global hotkey
must be registered using the desktop environment to send a DBus action to show
or hide the tilda window.

.SH "OPTIONS"
.SS "Help Options:"
.TP
\fB\-?\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Show help options
.SS "Application Options:"
.TP
\fB\-b\fR, \fB\-\-background\-color\fR \fIcolor\fR
Set the background \fIcolor\fR. The value can be either a standard color name from X11 or a hexadecimal value (i.e., #rgb, #rrggbb, etc.).
.TP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-command\fR \fIcommand\fR
Run a \fIcommand\fR at startup instead of the default shell.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-hidden\fR
Start Tilda hidden.
.TP
\fB\-f\fR, \fB\-\-font\fR \fIfont\fR
Set the font to the Pango FontDescription specified in \fIfont\fR. Defaults to "Monospace 11".
.TP
\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-lines\fR \fIlines\fR
The the scrollback buffer size to a maximum of \fIlines\fR.
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-scrollbar\fR
Show a scrollbar at the side of the terminal.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
Print the version, then exit.
.TP
\fB\-w\fR, \fB\-\-working\-dir\fR \fIdir\fR
Set initial working directory to \fIdir\fR.
.TP
\fB\-x\fR, \fB\-\-x\-pos\fR \fIx_pos\fR
Set the X position of the tilda terminal window to \fIx_pos\fR.
.TP
\fB\-y\fR, \fB\-\-y\-pos\fR \fIy_pos\fR
Set the Y position of the tilda terminal window to \fIy_pos\fR.
.TP
\fB\-t\fR, \fB\-\-background-alpha\fR \fIalpha\fR
Set the terminal windows transparency to \fIalpha\fR (i.e., 0\-100%). Higher values
increase the level of transparency.
.TP
\fB\-C\fR, \fB\-\-config\fR
Show the configuration wizard.
.TP
\fB\-\-display\fR=\fIDISPLAY\fR
Set the X display to use (i.e., :0, :0.0, etc.).
.TP
\fB\-\-dbus\fR
Enables DBus support (see \fIDBus\fR).
.SH "NOTES"
.SS DBus
Each Tilda process registers its own D-Bus name, so it is possible to
run multiple tilda processes each with their own config file and control
them separately via D-Bus.
.PP
Each tilda instance registers itself using a dynamically generated
bus name and object path using its instance number. The first tilda
instance will be on:
.TP
    com.github.lanoxx.tilda.Actions0
.PP
with object path:
.TP
    /com/github/lanoxx/tilda/Actions0
.PP
The interface name is always:
.TP
    com.github.lanoxx.tilda.Actions
.PP
To toggle the tilda window you can use \fBdbus-send\fR:
.TP
.EX
    dbus-send --session --type=method_call \\
       --dest=com.github.lanoxx.tilda.Actions0 \\
       /com/github/lanoxx/tilda/Actions0 \\
       com.github.lanoxx.tilda.Actions.Toggle
.EE
.PP
You can use the above command to register a global hotkey in your Wayland
session.
.PP
For each additional tilda instance the bus name and object path will
be incremented by one (e.g. Actions1, Actions2, etc.).
